# SQL Case Statements

## Introduction
The `CASE` statement in SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful tool used to perform conditional logic within queries. It allows users to define conditions and specify corresponding actions or values based on those conditions.

## Purpose of CASE Statements
The primary purpose of using `CASE` statements in SQL is to perform conditional transformations or assignments within queries. This enables users to customize query results based on specified conditions, providing flexibility and control over the output.

## Syntax
1. **Simple CASE Statement:**
   ```
   CASE expression
       WHEN value1 THEN result1
       WHEN value2 THEN result2
       ...
       ELSE default_result
   END
   ```
   
2. **Searched CASE Statement:**
   ```
   CASE
       WHEN condition1 THEN result1
       WHEN condition2 THEN result2
       ...
       ELSE default_result
   END
   ```
   
## Benefits of Using CASE Statements
1. **Conditional Logic:** `CASE` statements enable users to implement complex conditional logic directly within SQL queries.
2. **Customized Output:** Users can tailor query results based on specific conditions, allowing for customized data transformations.
3. **Readability:** `CASE` statements improve query readability by consolidating conditional logic into a single, understandable structure.
4. **Maintainability:** By centralizing conditional logic within queries, `CASE` statements enhance query maintainability and ease of modification.
5. **Performance:** Properly utilized `CASE` statements can improve query performance by reducing the need for multiple queries or post-processing steps.

## Best Practices
1. **Clarity:** Use descriptive conditions and results in `CASE` statements to enhance query readability and understanding.
2. **Consistency:** Maintain consistent formatting and indentation to ensure clarity and maintainability of `CASE` statements.
3. **Error Handling:** Include an `ELSE` clause to handle unexpected or null values, ensuring robustness in query execution.
4. **Avoid Nesting:** Minimize nesting of `CASE` statements to maintain code simplicity and readability.
5. **Testing:** Test `CASE` statements with various scenarios to verify correctness and effectiveness of conditional logic.

## Code Snippet
```sql
SELECT age, salary, job_title,
       CASE
           WHEN job_title = 'salesman' THEN salary + (salary * 2)
           WHEN job_title = 'analyst' THEN salary + (salary * 3)
           ELSE salary + (salary * 0.5)
       END AS salchange
FROM employeeDetails
JOIN employeeSalary ON employeeDetails.empid = employeeSalary.empid;
```

In this example, we're selecting `age`, `salary`, and `job_title` from the `employeeDetails` table and using a `CASE` statement to calculate `salchange` based on different conditions related to `job_title`.
